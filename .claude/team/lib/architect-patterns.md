## Architectural Patterns

### Layered Architecture

#### Intent

Organize code into horizontal layers where each layer depends only on layers below it, creating clear separation of concerns and reducing coupling.

#### When to Use

- **Monolithic applications** where clear module boundaries prevent spaghetti code
- **Enterprise systems** with well-defined business logic, data access, and presentation layers
- **Teams with role specialization** (frontend devs, backend devs, DBAs) working on different layers
- **Incremental modernization** where you need to replace one layer without affecting others

#### When to Avoid

- **Distributed systems** where network boundaries don't align with logical layers (creates chatty APIs)
- **High-performance systems** where cross-layer calls add unacceptable latency overhead
- **Rapidly evolving domains** where layer boundaries change frequently (causes cascading refactors)
- **Small microservices** where the overhead of 3-4 layers outweighs benefits (over-engineering)

#### Structure

```dot
digraph layered_architecture {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box, style="rounded,filled"];

    subgraph cluster_layers {
        label="Layered Architecture";
        style=dashed;

        presentation [label="Presentation Layer\n(UI, Controllers, DTOs)", fillcolor=lightblue];
        business [label="Business Logic Layer\n(Services, Domain Models, Rules)", fillcolor=lightgreen];
        persistence [label="Persistence Layer\n(Repositories, Data Access)", fillcolor=lightyellow];
        database [label="Database Layer\n(Schema, Migrations)", fillcolor=lightcoral];
    }

    presentation -> business [label="calls"];
    business -> persistence [label="calls"];
    persistence -> database [label="queries"];

    note1 [label="✓ Each layer depends only on layer below\n✗ No skip-layer dependencies", shape=note, fillcolor=white];
}
```

**Key Rules:**
- **Strict layering:** Layer N can only call Layer N-1 (no skipping layers)
- **Acyclic dependencies:** Lower layers never depend on higher layers
- **Cohesion:** Each layer has a single responsibility (presentation, business, data)

#### Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- **Clear separation:** Easy to understand where code belongs (UI code in presentation, business rules in logic layer)
- **Independent testing:** Can test business logic without database using mocks/stubs
- **Team scalability:** Different teams can own different layers with minimal coordination
- **Technology swapping:** Replace database (PostgreSQL → MongoDB) by changing only persistence layer

**Cons:**
- **Performance overhead:** Every operation crosses multiple layers (3-4 function calls minimum)
- **Rigid structure:** Hard to implement cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth) without violating layers
- **Anemic domain models:** Business layer often becomes thin wrappers around database entities
- **Change amplification:** Simple feature additions require touching all layers (presentation → business → persistence)

**Metrics:**
- Layer violation rate: Should be 0% (enforce with tools like `go-cleanarch`, `dependency-cruiser`)
- Average call depth: Typical 3-4 layers; >5 indicates over-layering
- Cross-layer coupling: Measure with cyclomatic complexity; aim for <10 dependencies per layer

#### Related Patterns

- **Clean Architecture:** Extends layered with dependency inversion (business layer at center)
- **Onion Architecture:** Similar to clean architecture with concentric dependency rings
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** Specialized layered pattern for presentation layer

---

### Hexagonal Architecture

#### Intent

Isolate core business logic from external concerns (databases, APIs, UI) by defining ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations), allowing the domain to remain independent of infrastructure.

#### When to Use

- **Domain-driven design** where business logic complexity justifies isolation from technical concerns
- **Multiple interfaces** to same business logic (REST API, GraphQL, CLI, batch jobs share domain)
- **Legacy system migration** where you need to swap databases/APIs without changing business rules
- **Test-first development** where you want to test business logic without spinning up databases/servers

#### When to Avoid

- **CRUD applications** with thin business logic (hexagonal adds ceremony without benefit)
- **Tight integration requirements** where business logic and infrastructure are inseparable (ETL pipelines)
- **Prototyping/MVPs** where flexibility to change domain logic quickly is more important than isolation
- **Small teams** unfamiliar with pattern (steep learning curve, easy to misuse)

#### Structure

```dot
digraph hexagonal_architecture {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box, style="rounded,filled"];

    subgraph cluster_core {
        label="Core (Domain)";
        style="filled";
        fillcolor=lightgreen;

        domain [label="Business Logic\n(Entities, Use Cases)", fillcolor=white];
        ports [label="Ports\n(Interfaces)", fillcolor=white, shape=ellipse];
    }

    subgraph cluster_adapters {
        label="Adapters (Infrastructure)";
        style=dashed;

        http_adapter [label="HTTP Adapter\n(REST API)", fillcolor=lightblue];
        cli_adapter [label="CLI Adapter\n(Commands)", fillcolor=lightblue];
        db_adapter [label="Database Adapter\n(PostgreSQL)", fillcolor=lightyellow];
        cache_adapter [label="Cache Adapter\n(Redis)", fillcolor=lightyellow];
    }

    http_adapter -> ports [label="drives", style=dashed];
    cli_adapter -> ports [label="drives", style=dashed];

    ports -> domain [label="calls"];

    domain -> ports [label="uses"];
    ports -> db_adapter [label="implements", style=dashed];
    ports -> cache_adapter [label="implements", style=dashed];

    note1 [label="Driving Adapters (Primary)\nInvoke use cases", shape=note, fillcolor=white];
    note2 [label="Driven Adapters (Secondary)\nProvide infrastructure", shape=note, fillcolor=white];
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Core/Domain:** Contains business logic, agnostic to frameworks/databases
- **Ports:** Interfaces defined by domain (input ports = use cases, output ports = repositories/services)
- **Adapters:** Concrete implementations of ports (HTTP handler, PostgreSQL repository)

**Dependency Rule:** All dependencies point inward toward the domain. Infrastructure depends on domain, not vice versa.

#### Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- **Technology agnostic:** Swap PostgreSQL for MongoDB by changing one adapter (domain unchanged)
- **Highly testable:** Test domain logic with in-memory adapters (no infrastructure needed)
- **Multiple interfaces:** Add new API (GraphQL, gRPC) by creating new driving adapter
- **Clear boundaries:** Impossible for infrastructure concerns to leak into business logic (compiler enforced)

**Cons:**
- **High initial complexity:** Requires defining ports, writing adapters, wiring dependency injection
- **Verbose codebase:** 3-4 files per feature (use case, port interface, adapter, tests) vs 1-2 in traditional layered
- **Mapping overhead:** Constant translation between domain entities and infrastructure DTOs (database rows, API responses)
- **Team learning curve:** Takes 2-3 months for team to internalize pattern and use correctly

**Metrics:**
- Adapter count per port: Should be ≥2 (if only 1 adapter per port, hexagonal is overkill)
- Domain-to-infrastructure dependency ratio: Should be 0:N (domain has zero outgoing dependencies)
- Test pyramid: Unit tests (domain) should outnumber integration tests 3:1

#### Related Patterns

- **Ports and Adapters:** Original name for hexagonal architecture
- **Clean Architecture:** Similar isolation with concentric circles instead of hexagon
- **Dependency Inversion Principle:** Core SOLID principle that hexagonal architecture enforces

---

### Microservices Architecture

#### Intent

Decompose application into small, independently deployable services that communicate over network, enabling teams to develop, deploy, and scale components independently.

#### When to Use

- **Large distributed teams** (>50 engineers) where coordination overhead of monolith becomes bottleneck
- **Polyglot requirements** where different components need different languages/frameworks (ML in Python, real-time in Go)
- **Independent scaling** where components have vastly different load patterns (auth service vs video processing)
- **Continuous deployment** where you need to deploy features multiple times per day without coordinating releases

#### When to Avoid

- **Small teams** (<10 engineers) where operational overhead outweighs benefits (monitoring, tracing, deployments)
- **Unknown domain boundaries** where service boundaries will change frequently (creates distributed monolith)
- **Strong consistency requirements** where transactions span services (2PC doesn't scale, sagas are complex)
- **Latency-sensitive systems** where network calls between services add unacceptable overhead (>50ms)

#### Structure

```dot
digraph microservices_architecture {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box, style="rounded,filled"];

    client [label="Client\n(Web/Mobile)", fillcolor=lightblue];

    subgraph cluster_gateway {
        label="API Gateway";
        style=filled;
        fillcolor=lightgray;
        gateway [label="Gateway\n(Routing, Auth)", fillcolor=white];
    }

    subgraph cluster_services {
        label="Microservices";
        style=dashed;

        user_service [label="User Service\n(Go, PostgreSQL)", fillcolor=lightgreen];
        order_service [label="Order Service\n(Go, PostgreSQL)", fillcolor=lightgreen];
        inventory_service [label="Inventory Service\n(Rust, Redis)", fillcolor=lightgreen];
        notification_service [label="Notification Service\n(Python, SQS)", fillcolor=lightgreen];
    }

    subgraph cluster_data {
        label="Data Layer";
        style=dashed;

        user_db [label="User DB", fillcolor=lightyellow];
        order_db [label="Order DB", fillcolor=lightyellow];
        inventory_cache [label="Inventory Cache", fillcolor=lightyellow];
        message_queue [label="Message Queue", fillcolor=lightyellow];
    }

    client -> gateway [label="HTTPS"];

    gateway -> user_service [label="REST"];
    gateway -> order_service [label="REST"];
    gateway -> inventory_service [label="gRPC"];

    order_service -> inventory_service [label="gRPC sync"];
    order_service -> notification_service [label="async event"];

    user_service -> user_db;
    order_service -> order_db;
    inventory_service -> inventory_cache;
    notification_service -> message_queue;

    note1 [label="✓ Each service owns its database\n✗ No shared database", shape=note, fillcolor=white];
}
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility:** Each service does one thing well (user management, order processing)
- **Database per Service:** No shared databases (avoids coupling at data layer)
- **API-based Communication:** Services communicate only via network APIs (REST, gRPC, events)

#### Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- **Independent deployment:** Deploy user service without touching order service (reduces coordination, speeds delivery)
- **Technology flexibility:** Use Go for high-throughput services, Python for ML, Rust for low-latency (best tool for job)
- **Team autonomy:** Each team owns 2-3 services end-to-end (no cross-team dependencies for features)
- **Fault isolation:** Order service crash doesn't take down user service (circuit breakers contain failures)
- **Granular scaling:** Scale inventory service to 100 instances, user service to 5 (optimize cost per component)

**Cons:**
- **Operational complexity:** 10 services = 10 deployments, 10 monitoring dashboards, 10 log streams (requires DevOps maturity)
- **Distributed debugging:** Tracing requests across 5 services with correlation IDs is harder than single process debugging
- **Data consistency challenges:** No distributed transactions; use eventual consistency with sagas/event sourcing (complex to implement)
- **Network latency overhead:** 4 service hops = 20-100ms added latency vs in-process function calls (<1ms)
- **Testing complexity:** Integration tests require spinning up 5+ services or maintaining complex mocks

**Metrics:**
- Service size: Should be <1000 LOC per service; >5000 LOC indicates service too large
- Service dependencies: Should be <3 sync dependencies per service; >5 indicates tight coupling
- Deployment frequency: Should be ≥1 deploy/week per service; <1/month indicates services too large
- P99 latency budget: Allocate 10-20ms per service hop; >5 hops indicates architecture issue

#### Related Patterns

- **Service Mesh:** Infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication (Istio, Linkerd)
- **API Gateway:** Single entry point for clients, handles routing/auth/rate-limiting
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Async communication pattern often used with microservices

---

### Event-Driven Architecture

#### Intent

Decouple components by having them react to events (state changes) rather than calling each other directly, enabling asynchronous communication and loose coupling.

#### When to Use

- **Asynchronous workflows** where components don't need immediate responses (order placed → email sent hours later)
- **Fan-out patterns** where one action triggers multiple independent reactions (user signup → send email, create profile, log analytics)
- **Event sourcing** where you need complete audit trail of all state changes (financial systems, compliance)
- **Scalable systems** where components have different processing speeds (slow video processing shouldn't block fast API)

#### When to Avoid

- **Synchronous requirements** where caller needs immediate response (user login → show dashboard requires user data now)
- **Simple CRUD apps** where direct database reads/writes are sufficient (event overhead not justified)
- **Strong ordering guarantees** where events must be processed in exact order (event systems guarantee at-least-once, not order)
- **Low-latency requirements** where event queue latency (10-100ms) is unacceptable (real-time trading, gaming)

#### Structure

```dot
digraph event_driven_architecture {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box, style="rounded,filled"];

    subgraph cluster_producers {
        label="Event Producers";
        style=filled;
        fillcolor=lightblue;

        user_service [label="User Service\n(Emits: UserCreated)", fillcolor=white];
        order_service [label="Order Service\n(Emits: OrderPlaced)", fillcolor=white];
    }

    subgraph cluster_broker {
        label="Event Broker";
        style=filled;
        fillcolor=lightgray;

        event_bus [label="Event Bus\n(Kafka/RabbitMQ/SQS)", fillcolor=white, shape=cylinder];
    }

    subgraph cluster_consumers {
        label="Event Consumers";
        style=filled;
        fillcolor=lightgreen;

        email_service [label="Email Service\n(Listens: UserCreated)", fillcolor=white];
        analytics_service [label="Analytics Service\n(Listens: UserCreated, OrderPlaced)", fillcolor=white];
        inventory_service [label="Inventory Service\n(Listens: OrderPlaced)", fillcolor=white];
    }

    user_service -> event_bus [label="publish"];
    order_service -> event_bus [label="publish"];

    event_bus -> email_service [label="subscribe"];
    event_bus -> analytics_service [label="subscribe"];
    event_bus -> inventory_service [label="subscribe"];

    note1 [label="✓ Producers don't know consumers exist\n✓ Consumers process independently", shape=note, fillcolor=white];
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Events:** Immutable facts about state changes (UserCreated, OrderPlaced, PaymentProcessed)
- **Producers:** Services that publish events when state changes
- **Consumers:** Services that subscribe to events and react independently
- **Event Broker:** Message queue that stores events and delivers to consumers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)

#### Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- **Loose coupling:** Email service can be added/removed without changing user service (producer doesn't know consumers exist)
- **Scalability:** Consumers process events at their own pace (slow video processing doesn't block fast API)
- **Flexibility:** Add new consumer for new feature without touching existing code (audit service subscribes to all events)
- **Resilience:** If email service is down, events queue up and process when it recovers (no data loss)
- **Audit trail:** Event log provides complete history of system state changes (replay events to debug)

**Cons:**
- **Eventual consistency:** User creation and email sending happen seconds/minutes apart (not immediate)
- **Debugging complexity:** Tracing event flow across 5 consumers harder than synchronous call stack
- **Message broker SPOF:** If Kafka is down, entire system stops publishing/consuming events (need HA setup)
- **Duplicate processing:** At-least-once delivery means consumers must be idempotent (handle same event twice)
- **Event schema evolution:** Changing event structure requires coordinating consumers (versioning strategies needed)

**Metrics:**
- Event processing lag: Should be <1 second for most events; >10 seconds indicates consumer bottleneck
- Dead letter queue size: Should be <1% of total events; high rate indicates consumer bugs
- Event throughput: Measure events/second; compare to broker capacity (Kafka sustains 1M events/sec)
- Consumer retry rate: Should be <5%; high rate indicates transient errors or bad events

#### Related Patterns

- **Event Sourcing:** Store events as source of truth instead of current state (enables time travel, audit)
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separate read and write models, synced via events
- **Saga Pattern:** Coordinate distributed transactions using events (order service → payment service → inventory service)

---

## Creational Patterns

### Factory Pattern

#### Intent

Encapsulate object creation logic to decouple client code from concrete types, allowing instantiation based on runtime conditions without exposing construction complexity.

#### When to Use

- **Multiple implementations** of an interface where selection depends on configuration/runtime data (DatabaseFactory returns PostgreSQL or MySQL client)
- **Complex construction logic** that shouldn't clutter client code (HTTP client with retries, circuit breakers, auth)
- **Plugin systems** where new types can be registered without modifying factory code
- **Testing** where you need to swap real implementations with mocks/fakes

#### When to Avoid

- **Single concrete type** with no alternatives (factory adds unnecessary indirection)
- **Simple constructors** with 1-2 parameters (direct instantiation is clearer)
- **Compile-time type selection** where generics/templates suffice (factory runtime overhead not needed)

#### Implementation Examples

**Go:**
```go
// Repository interface
type Repository interface {
    Save(ctx context.Context, entity Entity) error
    Find(ctx context.Context, id string) (Entity, error)
}

// Factory function
func NewRepository(dbType string, connStr string) (Repository, error) {
    switch dbType {
    case "postgres":
        return &PostgresRepository{connStr: connStr}, nil
    case "mysql":
        return &MySQLRepository{connStr: connStr}, nil
    default:
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("unsupported database type: %s", dbType)
    }
}

// Concrete implementations
type PostgresRepository struct{ connStr string }
func (r *PostgresRepository) Save(ctx context.Context, e Entity) error { /*...*/ }
func (r *PostgresRepository) Find(ctx context.Context, id string) (Entity, error) { /*...*/ }
```

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
// Repository interface
interface Repository {
  save(entity: Entity): Promise<void>;
  find(id: string): Promise<Entity | null>;
}

// Factory class
class RepositoryFactory {
  static create(dbType: string, connStr: string): Repository {
    switch (dbType) {
      case 'postgres':
        return new PostgresRepository(connStr);
      case 'mysql':
        return new MySQLRepository(connStr);
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unsupported database type: ${dbType}`);
    }
  }
}

// Concrete implementation
class PostgresRepository implements Repository {
  constructor(private connStr: string) {}
  async save(entity: Entity): Promise<void> { /*...*/ }
  async find(id: string): Promise<Entity | null> { /*...*/ }
}
```

**Rust:**
```rust
// Repository trait
trait Repository: Send + Sync {
    fn save(&self, entity: Entity) -> Result<(), Error>;
    fn find(&self, id: &str) -> Result<Option<Entity>, Error>;
}

// Factory function
fn new_repository(db_type: &str, conn_str: String) -> Result<Box<dyn Repository>, Error> {
    match db_type {
        "postgres" => Ok(Box::new(PostgresRepository { conn_str })),
        "mysql" => Ok(Box::new(MySQLRepository { conn_str })),
        _ => Err(Error::UnsupportedDatabase(db_type.to_string())),
    }
}

// Concrete implementation
struct PostgresRepository { conn_str: String }
impl Repository for PostgresRepository {
    fn save(&self, entity: Entity) -> Result<(), Error> { /*...*/ }
    fn find(&self, id: &str) -> Result<Option<Entity>, Error> { /*...*/ }
}
```

**Python:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Optional

# Repository interface
class Repository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save(self, entity: Entity) -> None: ...

    @abstractmethod
    def find(self, entity_id: str) -> Optional[Entity]: ...

# Factory function
def create_repository(db_type: str, conn_str: str) -> Repository:
    match db_type:
        case "postgres":
            return PostgresRepository(conn_str)
        case "mysql":
            return MySQLRepository(conn_str)
        case _:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported database type: {db_type}")

# Concrete implementation
class PostgresRepository(Repository):
    def __init__(self, conn_str: str):
        self.conn_str = conn_str

    def save(self, entity: Entity) -> None: ...
    def find(self, entity_id: str) -> Optional[Entity]: ...
```

#### Related Patterns

- **Abstract Factory:** Factory for creating families of related objects
- **Builder:** Alternative for complex construction with many optional parameters
- **Dependency Injection:** Replaces factory by injecting dependencies from configuration

---

### Builder Pattern

#### Intent

Separate complex object construction from its representation, allowing step-by-step creation with fluent API and ensuring all required fields are set before object is usable.

#### When to Use

- **Many optional parameters** where constructor with 10+ args is unreadable (HTTP client builder: timeout, retries, headers, auth)
- **Validation at construction** where invalid combinations must be prevented (date range: start before end)
- **Immutable objects** where all fields must be set before creation (no setters after construction)
- **Multiple representations** where same building steps produce different outputs (SQL query builder → raw SQL or parameterized)

#### When to Avoid

- **Simple objects** with 1-3 required fields (direct constructor is clearer)
- **Mutable objects** where setters after construction are acceptable (builder adds boilerplate)
- **Rarely changing APIs** where adding parameters is infrequent (builder overhead not justified)

#### Implementation Examples

**Go:**
```go
// Target struct (immutable after creation)
type HTTPClient struct {
    timeout       time.Duration
    retries       int
    headers       map[string]string
    circuitBreaker bool
}

// Builder
type HTTPClientBuilder struct {
    timeout       time.Duration
    retries       int
    headers       map[string]string
    circuitBreaker bool
}

func NewHTTPClientBuilder() *HTTPClientBuilder {
    return &HTTPClientBuilder{
        timeout: 30 * time.Second, // defaults
        retries: 3,
        headers: make(map[string]string),
    }
}

func (b *HTTPClientBuilder) WithTimeout(d time.Duration) *HTTPClientBuilder {
    b.timeout = d
    return b
}

func (b *HTTPClientBuilder) WithRetries(n int) *HTTPClientBuilder {
    b.retries = n
    return b
}

func (b *HTTPClientBuilder) WithHeader(key, val string) *HTTPClientBuilder {
    b.headers[key] = val
    return b
}

func (b *HTTPClientBuilder) WithCircuitBreaker() *HTTPClientBuilder {
    b.circuitBreaker = true
    return b
}

func (b *HTTPClientBuilder) Build() (*HTTPClient, error) {
    if b.timeout <= 0 {
        return nil, errors.New("timeout must be positive")
    }
    return &HTTPClient{
        timeout:       b.timeout,
        retries:       b.retries,
        headers:       b.headers,
        circuitBreaker: b.circuitBreaker,
    }, nil
}

// Usage
client, err := NewHTTPClientBuilder().
    WithTimeout(10 * time.Second).
    WithRetries(5).
    WithHeader("User-Agent", "MyApp/1.0").
    WithCircuitBreaker().
    Build()
```

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
// Target class (immutable after creation)
class HTTPClient {
  constructor(
    readonly timeout: number,
    readonly retries: number,
    readonly headers: Map<string, string>,
    readonly circuitBreaker: boolean
  ) {}
}

// Builder
class HTTPClientBuilder {
  private timeout = 30000; // defaults
  private retries = 3;
  private headers = new Map<string, string>();
  private circuitBreaker = false;

  withTimeout(ms: number): this {
    this.timeout = ms;
    return this;
  }

  withRetries(n: number): this {
    this.retries = n;
    return this;
  }

  withHeader(key: string, value: string): this {
    this.headers.set(key, value);
    return this;
  }

  withCircuitBreaker(): this {
    this.circuitBreaker = true;
    return this;
  }

  build(): HTTPClient {
    if (this.timeout <= 0) {
      throw new Error('Timeout must be positive');
    }
    return new HTTPClient(
      this.timeout,
      this.retries,
      this.headers,
      this.circuitBreaker
    );
  }
}

// Usage
const client = new HTTPClientBuilder()
  .withTimeout(10000)
  .withRetries(5)
  .withHeader('User-Agent', 'MyApp/1.0')
  .withCircuitBreaker()
  .build();
```

**Rust:**
```rust
// Target struct (immutable after creation)
#[derive(Debug)]
struct HTTPClient {
    timeout: Duration,
    retries: u32,
    headers: HashMap<String, String>,
    circuit_breaker: bool,
}

// Builder
struct HTTPClientBuilder {
    timeout: Duration,
    retries: u32,
    headers: HashMap<String, String>,
    circuit_breaker: bool,
}

#### Related Patterns

- **Factory:** Alternative when construction logic is simple (no multi-step building)
- **Fluent Interface:** Builder uses fluent API (method chaining) for ergonomics
- **Immutable Object:** Builder ensures all fields set before creating immutable instance

---

### Singleton Pattern

#### Intent

Ensure a class has only one instance and provide global access point, typically for shared resources like configuration, connection pools, or caches.

#### When to Use

- **Shared state** that must be consistent across application (application config, feature flags)
- **Resource pools** where multiple instances waste resources (database connection pool, thread pool)
- **Coordination point** for distributed locks, rate limiters, or circuit breakers
- **Logging/metrics** where centralized collection is required

#### When to Avoid

- **Testability matters** where singleton makes mocking difficult (use dependency injection instead)
- **Mutable global state** that creates hidden dependencies between modules (breaks modularity)
- **Concurrency is required** where singleton becomes contention point (consider per-thread instances)
- **Lifecycle management needed** where singleton lives for entire process (can't restart/reset)

#### Concurrency Safety

**Critical:** Singleton initialization MUST be thread-safe. Use language-provided mechanisms:
- **Go:** `sync.Once` guarantees single execution
- **TypeScript:** Module scope ensures single instance (Node.js modules are singletons)
- **Rust:** `lazy_static!` or `std::sync::OnceLock` for thread-safe init
- **Python:** Module-level variable or `threading.Lock` for manual control

#### Implementation Examples

**Go (Thread-Safe with sync.Once):**
```go
import "sync"

type Config struct {
    APIKey      string
    Environment string
}

var (
    instance *Config
    once     sync.Once
)

func GetConfig() *Config {
    once.Do(func() {
        instance = &Config{
            APIKey:      loadAPIKey(),
            Environment: loadEnvironment(),
        }
    })
    return instance
}

// Usage
config := GetConfig()
fmt.Println(config.APIKey)
```

**TypeScript (Module Scope):**
```typescript
// config.ts
class Config {
  readonly apiKey: string;
  readonly environment: string;

  constructor() {
    this.apiKey = loadAPIKey();
    this.environment = loadEnvironment();
  }
}

// Module-scope singleton (Node.js modules are cached)
export const config = new Config();

// Usage (in other files)
import { config } from './config';
console.log(config.apiKey);
```

**Rust (lazy_static):**
```rust
use lazy_static::lazy_static;
use std::sync::RwLock;

struct Config {
    api_key: String,
    environment: String,
}

lazy_static! {
    static ref CONFIG: RwLock<Config> = RwLock::new(Config {
        api_key: load_api_key(),
        environment: load_environment(),
    });
}

// Usage
fn main() {
    let config = CONFIG.read().unwrap();
    println!("{}", config.api_key);
}
```

**Python (Module-Level Variable):**
```python
# config.py
class Config:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_key = load_api_key()
        self.environment = load_environment()

# Module-level singleton
_instance: Config | None = None

def get_config() -> Config:
    global _instance
    if _instance is None:
        _instance = Config()
    return _instance

# Usage
from config import get_config
config = get_config()
print(config.api_key)
```

#### Related Patterns

- **Dependency Injection:** Preferred alternative that maintains testability
- **Monostate:** Shares state without enforcing single instance
- **Registry:** Maps keys to singleton instances (service locator pattern)

## Structural Patterns

### Repository Pattern

#### Intent

Encapsulate data access logic behind interface that mimics collection semantics (Add, Remove, Find), isolating domain layer from persistence concerns and enabling easier testing/swapping of storage backends.

#### When to Use

- **Domain-Driven Design** where business logic must be decoupled from database details
- **Multiple storage backends** where you need to support PostgreSQL, MongoDB, in-memory (tests)
- **Complex queries** that should be hidden behind domain-meaningful methods (FindActiveUsersByRole vs raw SQL)
- **Testing** where in-memory repository allows testing business logic without database

#### When to Avoid

- **Simple CRUD apps** where ORM already provides abstraction (repository adds duplication)
- **Reporting/analytics** where complex SQL queries don't map to domain operations (use query objects)
- **High-performance paths** where repository abstraction adds measurable overhead (bypass for hot paths)

#### Implementation Examples

**Go:**
```go
// Domain entity
type User struct {
    ID        string
    Email     string
    Active    bool
    CreatedAt time.Time
}

// Repository interface (domain layer)
type UserRepository interface {
    Add(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
    Remove(ctx context.Context, id string) error
    Find(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error)
    FindByEmail(ctx context.Context, email string) (*User, error)
    FindAllActive(ctx context.Context) ([]*User, error)
}

// PostgreSQL implementation (infrastructure layer)
type PostgresUserRepository struct {
    db *sql.DB
}

func NewPostgresUserRepository(db *sql.DB) *PostgresUserRepository {
    return &PostgresUserRepository{db: db}
}

func (r *PostgresUserRepository) Add(ctx context.Context, user *User) error {
    query := `INSERT INTO users (id, email, active, created_at) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)`
    _, err := r.db.ExecContext(ctx, query, user.ID, user.Email, user.Active, user.CreatedAt)
    return err
}

func (r *PostgresUserRepository) Find(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error) {
    query := `SELECT id, email, active, created_at FROM users WHERE id = $1`
    var user User
    err := r.db.QueryRowContext(ctx, query, id).Scan(&user.ID, &user.Email, &user.Active, &user.CreatedAt)
    if err == sql.ErrNoRows {
        return nil, ErrUserNotFound
    }
    return &user, err
}

// In-memory implementation (testing)
type InMemoryUserRepository struct {
    users map[string]*User
    mu    sync.RWMutex
}

func NewInMemoryUserRepository() *InMemoryUserRepository {
    return &InMemoryUserRepository{users: make(map[string]*User)}
}

func (r *InMemoryUserRepository) Add(ctx context.Context, user *User) error {
    r.mu.Lock()
    defer r.mu.Unlock()
    r.users[user.ID] = user
    return nil
}

func (r *InMemoryUserRepository) Find(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error) {
    r.mu.RLock()
    defer r.mu.RUnlock()
    user, ok := r.users[id]
    if !ok {
        return nil, ErrUserNotFound
    }
    return user, nil
}
```

#### Related Patterns

- **Data Mapper:** Maps between domain objects and database records (repository uses mapper internally)
- **Unit of Work:** Tracks changes across multiple repositories and commits atomically
- **Specification:** Encapsulates query logic as composable objects (FindBySpec)

---

### Decorator Pattern

#### Intent

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically without modifying its structure, providing flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

#### When to Use

- **Cross-cutting concerns** like logging, caching, auth that apply to multiple objects (wrap repository with cache decorator)
- **Composable features** where combinations of behaviors are needed (compression + encryption on streams)
- **Runtime feature toggling** where decoration decisions depend on config (enable metrics only in production)
- **Middleware chains** where request processing passes through multiple handlers (HTTP middleware)

#### When to Avoid

- **Simple cases** where single level of wrapping suffices (just use wrapper function)
- **Many decorators** where order matters and debugging is hard (prefer explicit composition)
- **Performance-critical paths** where function call overhead is measurable (inline critical logic)

#### Implementation Examples

**Go (Caching Repository Decorator):**
```go
// Base repository interface
type UserRepository interface {
    Find(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error)
    Save(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
}

// Decorator: adds caching
type CachedUserRepository struct {
    base  UserRepository
    cache *Cache
    ttl   time.Duration
}

func NewCachedUserRepository(base UserRepository, cache *Cache, ttl time.Duration) *CachedUserRepository {
    return &CachedUserRepository{base: base, cache: cache, ttl: ttl}
}

func (r *CachedUserRepository) Find(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error) {
    // Check cache first
    if user, found := r.cache.Get(id); found {
        return user.(*User), nil
    }

    // Cache miss: delegate to base
    user, err := r.base.Find(ctx, id)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Store in cache
    r.cache.Set(id, user, r.ttl)
    return user, nil
}

func (r *CachedUserRepository) Save(ctx context.Context, user *User) error {
    // Invalidate cache
    r.cache.Delete(user.ID)

    // Delegate to base
    return r.base.Save(ctx, user)
}

// Usage: stack decorators
baseRepo := NewPostgresUserRepository(db)
cachedRepo := NewCachedUserRepository(baseRepo, cache, 5*time.Minute)
loggedRepo := NewLoggedUserRepository(cachedRepo, logger)

user, err := loggedRepo.Find(ctx, "user-123")  // logs -> cache -> postgres
```

**TypeScript (HTTP Middleware Decorator):**
```typescript
// Base handler interface
interface HttpHandler {
  handle(req: Request): Promise<Response>;
}

// Concrete handler
class UserHandler implements HttpHandler {
  async handle(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
    const user = await getUserFromDB(req.params.id);
    return { status: 200, body: user };
  }
}

// Decorator: adds logging
class LoggingHandler implements HttpHandler {
  constructor(
    private base: HttpHandler,
    private logger: Logger
  ) {}

  async handle(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
    this.logger.info(`Request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    const start = Date.now();

    const response = await this.base.handle(req);

    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    this.logger.info(`Response: ${response.status} (${duration}ms)`);
    return response;
  }
}

// Decorator: adds auth
class AuthHandler implements HttpHandler {
  constructor(
    private base: HttpHandler,
    private authService: AuthService
  ) {}

  async handle(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
    if (!await this.authService.isAuthenticated(req)) {
      return { status: 401, body: { error: 'Unauthorized' } };
    }
    return this.base.handle(req);
  }
}

// Usage: stack decorators
const handler = new LoggingHandler(
  new AuthHandler(
    new UserHandler(),
    authService
  ),
  logger
);

const response = await handler.handle(request);  // logs -> auth -> user handler
```

**Rust (Stream Decorator):**
```rust
use std::io::{Read, Write};

// Base trait (Stream)
trait Stream: Read + Write {}

// Concrete stream
struct NetworkStream { /* socket */ }
impl Read for NetworkStream { /* ... */ }
impl Write for NetworkStream { /* ... */ }
impl Stream for NetworkStream {}

// Decorator: compression
struct CompressedStream<S: Stream> {
    inner: S,
    compressor: Compressor,
}

impl<S: Stream> CompressedStream<S> {
    fn new(stream: S) -> Self {
        Self { inner: stream, compressor: Compressor::new() }
    }
}

impl<S: Stream> Read for CompressedStream<S> {
    fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> std::io::Result<usize> {
        let mut compressed = vec![0; buf.len()];
        let n = self.inner.read(&mut compressed)?;
        let decompressed = self.compressor.decompress(&compressed[..n]);
        buf[..decompressed.len()].copy_from_slice(&decompressed);
        Ok(decompressed.len())
    }
}

impl<S: Stream> Write for CompressedStream<S> {
    fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> std::io::Result<usize> {
        let compressed = self.compressor.compress(buf);
        self.inner.write(&compressed)
    }
}

// Decorator: encryption
struct EncryptedStream<S: Stream> {
    inner: S,
    cipher: Cipher,
}

// Usage: stack decorators
let network = NetworkStream::connect("example.com:443")?;
let compressed = CompressedStream::new(network);
let encrypted = EncryptedStream::new(compressed);

encrypted.write(b"secret data")?;  // encrypts -> compresses -> sends
```

**Python (Function Decorator for Retry Logic):**
```python
import functools
import time
from typing import Callable, TypeVar, Any

T = TypeVar('T')

# Decorator: retry on failure
def retry(max_attempts: int = 3, delay: float = 1.0):
    def decorator(func: Callable[..., T]) -> Callable[..., T]:
        @functools.wraps(func)

                    if attempt < max_attempts - 1:
                        time.sleep(delay * (2 ** attempt))  # exponential backoff
            raise last_exception
        return wrapper
    return decorator

# Decorator: logging

        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Usage: stack decorators
@logged
@retry(max_attempts=5, delay=2.0)
def fetch_user(user_id: str) -> User:
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}")
    response.raise_for_status()
    return User(**response.json())

user = fetch_user("user-123")  # logs -> retries on failure -> fetches
```

#### Related Patterns

- **Proxy:** Controls access to object (decorator adds behavior)
- **Chain of Responsibility:** Each handler decides whether to pass to next (decorator always delegates)
- **Composite:** Decorator wraps single object; composite wraps multiple

---

### Adapter Pattern

#### Intent

Convert interface of a class into another interface clients expect, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together without modifying original code.

#### When to Use

- **Third-party integration** where library interface doesn't match your domain (wrap Stripe API to match Payment interface)
- **Legacy system migration** where old and new systems must coexist (adapter bridges interfaces)
- **Multiple implementations** where each has different interface (adapt PostgreSQL and MongoDB to Repository)
- **Testing** where you need to adapt real services to testable interfaces (adapt HTTP client to interface)

#### When to Avoid

- **You control both interfaces** where you can just change the interface directly
- **Simple mapping** where single function suffices (no need for adapter class)
- **Performance-critical** where adapter overhead is measurable (inline adaptation)

#### Implementation Examples

**Go (Payment Gateway Adapter):**
```go
// Domain interface (what your code expects)
type PaymentGateway interface {
    ProcessPayment(ctx context.Context, amount Money, cardToken string) (PaymentResult, error)
    RefundPayment(ctx context.Context, transactionID string) error
}

// Third-party library (Stripe) with incompatible interface
type StripeClient struct {
    apiKey string
}

func (c *StripeClient) Charge(params StripeChargeParams) (*StripeCharge, error) { /*...*/ }
func (c *StripeClient) CreateRefund(chargeID string) (*StripeRefund, error) { /*...*/ }

// Adapter: Stripe -> PaymentGateway
type StripeAdapter struct {
    client *StripeClient
}

func NewStripeAdapter(apiKey string) *StripeAdapter {
    return &StripeAdapter{client: &StripeClient{apiKey: apiKey}}
}

func (a *StripeAdapter) ProcessPayment(ctx context.Context, amount Money, cardToken string) (PaymentResult, error) {
    // Translate domain types to Stripe types
    params := StripeChargeParams{
        Amount:   int64(amount.Cents),
        Currency: string(amount.Currency),
        Source:   cardToken,
    }

    charge, err := a.client.Charge(params)
    if err != nil {
        return PaymentResult{}, err
    }

    // Translate Stripe response to domain types
    return PaymentResult{
        TransactionID: charge.ID,
        Status:        translateStatus(charge.Status),
        AmountCharged: amount,
    }, nil
}

func (a *StripeAdapter) RefundPayment(ctx context.Context, transactionID string) error {
    _, err := a.client.CreateRefund(transactionID)
    return err
}

// Usage: swap payment gateways without changing business logic
var gateway PaymentGateway
if config.PaymentProvider == "stripe" {
    gateway = NewStripeAdapter(config.StripeAPIKey)
} else {
    gateway = NewPayPalAdapter(config.PayPalAPIKey)
}

result, err := gateway.ProcessPayment(ctx, money.Dollars(50), cardToken)
```

**TypeScript (Logger Adapter):**
```typescript
// Domain interface (what your code expects)
interface Logger {
  log(level: string, message: string, meta?: Record<string, any>): void;
}

// Third-party library (Winston) with different interface
import * as winston from 'winston';

// Adapter: Winston -> Logger
class WinstonAdapter implements Logger {
  private winston: winston.Logger;

  constructor(options: winston.LoggerOptions) {
    this.winston = winston.createLogger(options);
  }

  log(level: string, message: string, meta?: Record<string, any>): void {
    // Translate to Winston's interface
    this.winston.log({
      level: this.translateLevel(level),
      message,
      ...meta
    });
  }

  private translateLevel(level: string): string {
    // Map your levels to Winston's levels
    const mapping: Record<string, string> = {
      'debug': 'debug',
      'info': 'info',
      'warning': 'warn',
      'error': 'error'
    };
    return mapping[level] || 'info';
  }
}

// Adapter: Console -> Logger (for testing)
class ConsoleAdapter implements Logger {
  log(level: string, message: string, meta?: Record<string, any>): void {
    const metaStr = meta ? ` ${JSON.stringify(meta)}` : '';
    console.log(`[${level}] ${message}${metaStr}`);
  }
}

// Usage: swap loggers without changing application code
const logger: Logger = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? new WinstonAdapter({ transports: [new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'app.log' })] })
  : new ConsoleAdapter();

logger.log('info', 'User logged in', { userId: '123' });
```

**Rust (Storage Adapter):**
```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;

// Domain interface (what your code expects)
#[async_trait]
trait Storage: Send + Sync {
    async fn store(&self, key: &str, data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<(), Error>;

        // AWS SDK specific code
    }
}

// Adapter: S3 -> Storage
struct S3StorageAdapter {
    client: S3Client,
    bucket: String,
}

#[async_trait]
impl Storage for S3StorageAdapter {
    async fn store(&self, key: &str, data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<(), Error> {
        self.client
            .put_object(&self.bucket, key, data)
            .await
            .map_err(|e| Error::Storage(e.to_string()))
    }

    async fn retrieve(&self, key: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Error> {
        self.client
            .get_object(&self.bucket, key)
            .await
            .map_err(|e| Error::Storage(e.to_string()))
    }

    async fn delete(&self, key: &str) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // Translate to S3's delete_object
        Ok(())
    }
}

// Adapter: Local filesystem -> Storage
struct FileSystemAdapter {
    base_path: PathBuf,
}

#[async_trait]
impl Storage for FileSystemAdapter {

        let data = tokio::fs::read(path).await?;
        Ok(data)
    }
}

// Usage: swap storage backends
let storage: Box<dyn Storage> = if config.storage_type == "s3" {
    Box::new(S3StorageAdapter { client: s3_client, bucket: config.bucket })
} else {

#### Related Patterns

- **Bridge:** Separates abstraction from implementation (adapter retrofits existing classes)
- **Facade:** Simplifies complex subsystem (adapter matches specific interface)
- **Proxy:** Controls access (adapter changes interface)

---

### Facade Pattern

#### Intent

Provide simplified unified interface to complex subsystem, hiding implementation details and reducing dependencies between client code and subsystem components.

#### When to Use

- **Complex subsystems** with many classes/interfaces where clients need only subset (database migrations: schema, seeding, rollback wrapped in single `Migrate()` call)
- **Layered architecture** where facade represents clean API for layer (business layer facade hides service classes)
- **Third-party integration** where you want to isolate API complexity (wrap AWS SDK's 50 methods behind 5 methods)
- **Refactoring** where facade provides stable interface while internals change

#### When to Avoid

- **Simple subsystems** with 1-2 classes (facade adds unnecessary indirection)
- **Clients need fine-grained control** where facade hides required functionality
- **Tight coupling acceptable** where clients should know subsystem details (internal teams)

#### Implementation Examples

#### Related Patterns

- **Adapter:** Changes interface of single class (facade simplifies multiple classes)
- **Mediator:** Facilitates communication between objects (facade provides access to subsystem)
- **Abstract Factory:** Creates family of objects (facade provides access to existing objects)

---

## Behavioral Patterns

### Observer Pattern

#### Intent

Define one-to-many dependency between objects so when one object changes state, all dependents are notified automatically, enabling loose coupling between subject and observers.

#### When to Use

- **Event systems** where multiple subscribers need notification of state changes (UI updates when model changes)
- **Pub/Sub messaging** where producers and consumers are decoupled (event bus, message broker)
- **Real-time updates** where clients need push notifications (stock prices, chat messages)
- **Distributed systems** where services react to events from other services

#### When to Avoid

- **Synchronous workflows** where caller needs immediate response (observer adds async complexity)
- **Few observers** where direct method calls are clearer (1-2 observers don't justify pattern)
- **Performance-critical paths** where observer notification overhead is measurable
- **Complex dependencies** where observer updates trigger cascading updates (hard to debug)

#### Implementation Examples

**Go (Channel-Based Observer):**
```go
// Subject interface
type Subject interface {
    Attach(observer Observer)
    Detach(observer Observer)
    Notify(event Event)
}

// Observer interface
type Observer interface {
    Update(event Event)
}

// Concrete subject: stock price feed
type StockPriceFeed struct {
    observers []Observer
    mu        sync.RWMutex
}

func NewStockPriceFeed() *StockPriceFeed {
    return &StockPriceFeed{observers: make([]Observer, 0)}
}

func (s *StockPriceFeed) Attach(observer Observer) {
    s.mu.Lock()
    defer s.mu.Unlock()
    s.observers = append(s.observers, observer)
}

func (s *StockPriceFeed) Detach(observer Observer) {
    s.mu.Lock()
    defer s.mu.Unlock()
    for i, obs := range s.observers {
        if obs == observer {
            s.observers = append(s.observers[:i], s.observers[i+1:]...)
            break
        }
    }
}

func (s *StockPriceFeed) Notify(event Event) {
    s.mu.RLock()
    defer s.mu.RUnlock()
    for _, observer := range s.observers {
        // Notify asynchronously to avoid blocking
        go observer.Update(event)
    }
}

func (s *StockPriceFeed) UpdatePrice(symbol string, price float64) {
    event := Event{
        Type: "PriceUpdate",
        Data: map[string]interface{}{
            "symbol": symbol,
            "price":  price,
            "time":   time.Now(),
        },
    }
    s.Notify(event)
}

// Concrete observer: price alert
type PriceAlert struct {
    symbol    string
    threshold float64
    alerts    chan string
}

func NewPriceAlert(symbol string, threshold float64) *PriceAlert {
    return &PriceAlert{
        symbol:    symbol,
        threshold: threshold,
        alerts:    make(chan string, 10),
    }
}

func (p *PriceAlert) Update(event Event) {
    if event.Type != "PriceUpdate" {
        return
    }

    symbol := event.Data["symbol"].(string)
    price := event.Data["price"].(float64)

    if symbol == p.symbol && price >= p.threshold {
        p.alerts <- fmt.Sprintf("Alert: %s reached $%.2f", symbol, price)
    }
}

// Usage
feed := NewStockPriceFeed()
alert1 := NewPriceAlert("AAPL", 150.0)
alert2 := NewPriceAlert("AAPL", 200.0)

feed.Attach(alert1)
feed.Attach(alert2)

feed.UpdatePrice("AAPL", 175.50)  // Notifies both alerts
```

**TypeScript (EventEmitter Pattern):**
```typescript
// Subject interface
interface Subject {
  attach(observer: Observer): void;
  detach(observer: Observer): void;
  notify(event: Event): void;
}

// Observer interface
interface Observer {
  update(event: Event): void;
}

// Event type
interface Event {
  type: string;
  data: Record<string, any>;
}

// Concrete subject using EventEmitter pattern
class OrderService implements Subject {
  private observers = new Set<Observer>();

  attach(observer: Observer): void {
    this.observers.add(observer);
  }

  detach(observer: Observer): void {
    this.observers.delete(observer);
  }

  notify(event: Event): void {
    // Notify all observers asynchronously
    for (const observer of this.observers) {
      Promise.resolve().then(() => observer.update(event));
    }
  }

  async placeOrder(order: Order): Promise<void> {
    // Process order
    await this.saveToDatabase(order);

    // Notify observers
    this.notify({
      type: 'OrderPlaced',
      data: {
        orderId: order.id,
        customerId: order.customerId,
        total: order.total,
        timestamp: new Date()
      }
    });
  }
}

// Concrete observer: email notification

  constructor(private emailService: EmailService) {}

  update(event: Event): void {
    if (event.type === 'OrderPlaced') {
      const { orderId, customerId } = event.data;
      this.emailService.send({
        to: this.getCustomerEmail(customerId),
        subject: 'Order Confirmation',
        body: `Your order ${orderId} has been placed.`
      });
    }
  }
}

class InventoryUpdater implements Observer {
  constructor(private inventoryService: InventoryService) {}

    if (event.type === 'OrderPlaced') {
      const { orderId } = event.data;
      this.inventoryService.reserveItems(orderId);
    }
  }
}

// Usage
const orderService = new OrderService();
const emailNotifier = new EmailNotifier(emailService);
const inventoryUpdater = new InventoryUpdater(inventoryService);

orderService.attach(emailNotifier);
orderService.attach(inventoryUpdater);

await orderService.placeOrder(order);  // Notifies both observers
```

use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock};

// Observer trait
trait Observer: Send + Sync {
    fn update(&self, event: &Event);
}

// Event type
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]

    }

    fn detach(&mut self, observer_id: usize) {
        if observer_id < self.observers.len() {

**Python (Property-Based Observer):**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List, Any, Dict
import asyncio

# Observer interface
class Observer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def update(self, event: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        pass

# Subject interface
class Subject(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers: List[Observer] = []

    def attach(self, observer: Observer) -> None:
        if observer not in self._observers:
            self._observers.append(observer)

    def detach(self, observer: Observer) -> None:
        if observer in self._observers:
            self._observers.remove(observer)

    def notify(self, event: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:

# Usage

```

#### Related Patterns

- **Mediator:** Centralizes communication (observer is decentralized)
- **Event Sourcing:** Stores events as source of truth (observer reacts to events)
- **Pub/Sub:** Distributed observer pattern with message broker

### Strategy Pattern

#### Intent

Define family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable, allowing algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

#### When to Use

- **Multiple algorithms** for same task where selection depends on context (sorting: quicksort vs mergesort vs heapsort)
- **Conditional complexity** where many if/else branches select behavior (payment: credit card vs PayPal vs crypto)
- **Runtime algorithm selection** based on configuration or user input (compression: none vs gzip vs brotli)
- **Testing** where you want to inject different behaviors (real vs mock implementations)

#### When to Avoid

- **Single algorithm** that never changes (strategy adds unnecessary abstraction)
- **Simple logic** where function parameter suffices (no need for strategy interface)
- **Compile-time selection** where generics/templates are clearer (strategy is runtime)

#### Implementation Examples

**Go (Interface-Based Strategy):**
```go
// Strategy interface
type CompressionStrategy interface {
    Compress(data []byte) ([]byte, error)
    Decompress(data []byte) ([]byte, error)
}

// Concrete strategy: Gzip
type GzipCompression struct {
    level int
}

func (g *GzipCompression) Compress(data []byte) ([]byte, error) {
    var buf bytes.Buffer
    writer, _ := gzip.NewWriterLevel(&buf, g.level)
    writer.Write(data)
    writer.Close()
    return buf.Bytes(), nil
}

func (g *GzipCompression) Decompress(data []byte) ([]byte, error) {
    reader, err := gzip.NewReader(bytes.NewReader(data))
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer reader.Close()
    return io.ReadAll(reader)
}

// Concrete strategy: Zstd
type ZstdCompression struct {
    level int
}

func (z *ZstdCompression) Compress(data []byte) ([]byte, error) {
    encoder, _ := zstd.NewWriter(nil, zstd.WithEncoderLevel(zstd.EncoderLevel(z.level)))
    return encoder.EncodeAll(data, nil), nil
}

func (z *ZstdCompression) Decompress(data []byte) ([]byte, error) {
    decoder, _ := zstd.NewReader(nil)
    return decoder.DecodeAll(data, nil)
}

// Context: file compressor
type FileCompressor struct {
    strategy CompressionStrategy
}

func NewFileCompressor(strategy CompressionStrategy) *FileCompressor {
    return &FileCompressor{strategy: strategy}
}

func (f *FileCompressor) SetStrategy(strategy CompressionStrategy) {
    f.strategy = strategy
}

func (f *FileCompressor) CompressFile(inputPath, outputPath string) error {
    data, err := os.ReadFile(inputPath)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    compressed, err := f.strategy.Compress(data)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    return os.WriteFile(outputPath, compressed, 0644)
}

// Usage: swap strategies at runtime
compressor := NewFileCompressor(&GzipCompression{level: 6})
compressor.CompressFile("input.txt", "output.gz")

// Switch strategy
compressor.SetStrategy(&ZstdCompression{level: 3})
compressor.CompressFile("input.txt", "output.zst")
```

#### Related Patterns

- **State:** Strategy with methods that change state (strategy is stateless algorithms)
- **Template Method:** Defines algorithm skeleton (strategy swaps entire algorithm)
- **Dependency Injection:** Injects strategy implementation at runtime

---

### Command Pattern

#### Intent

Encapsulate request as object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and support for undoable operations.

#### When to Use

- **Undo/redo functionality** where operations must be reversible (text editor, graphics app)
- **Transaction systems** where operations are queued and executed later (database transactions, job queues)
- **Command history** where you need audit trail of actions (user activity log)
- **Macro recording** where series of commands can be replayed (automation, testing)

#### When to Avoid

- **Simple operations** where direct method calls suffice (command adds ceremony)
- **No queuing/undo needed** where immediate execution is fine (command overhead not justified)
- **Stateless operations** that can't be reversed or replayed meaningfully

#### Implementation Examples

**Go (Interface-Based Command):**
```go
// Command interface
type Command interface {
    Execute() error
    Undo() error
    Description() string
}

// Receiver: document
type Document struct {
    content string
    mu      sync.Mutex
}

func (d *Document) Insert(text string, position int) {
    d.mu.Lock()
    defer d.mu.Unlock()
    d.content = d.content[:position] + text + d.content[position:]
}

func (d *Document) Delete(length int, position int) string {
    d.mu.Lock()
    defer d.mu.Unlock()
    deleted := d.content[position : position+length]
    d.content = d.content[:position] + d.content[position+length:]
    return deleted
}

// Concrete command: insert text
type InsertCommand struct {
    doc      *Document
    text     string
    position int
}

func NewInsertCommand(doc *Document, text string, position int) *InsertCommand {
    return &InsertCommand{doc: doc, text: text, position: position}
}

func (c *InsertCommand) Execute() error {
    c.doc.Insert(c.text, c.position)

#### Related Patterns

- **Memento:** Stores object state for undo (command stores operation for undo)
- **Chain of Responsibility:** Passes request along chain (command encapsulates request)
- **Composite:** Commands can be composed into macro commands

---

### Chain of Responsibility

#### Intent

Avoid coupling sender of request to receiver by giving multiple objects chance to handle request, passing request along chain until object handles it.

#### When to Use

- **Multiple handlers** where each can process request or pass to next (logging: console → file → remote)
- **Handler order matters** where processing follows priority/sequence (auth → rate limiting → validation)
- **Dynamic handler chains** where handlers added/removed at runtime (middleware pipeline)
- **Event bubbling** where event propagates through hierarchy until handled (UI event system)

#### When to Avoid

- **Single handler** that always processes request (chain adds unnecessary complexity)
- **All handlers must execute** where chain stops at first handler (use decorator or composite)
- **Performance-critical** where chain traversal overhead is measurable

#### Implementation Examples

**Go (Function Chain):**
```go
// Handler interface
type Handler interface {
    Handle(request *Request) error
    SetNext(handler Handler)
}

// Base handler
type BaseHandler struct {
    next Handler
}

func (h *BaseHandler) SetNext(handler Handler) {
    h.next = handler
}

func (h *BaseHandler) HandleNext(request *Request) error {
    if h.next != nil {
        return h.next.Handle(request)
    }
    return nil
}

// Concrete handler: authentication
type AuthHandler struct {
    BaseHandler
}

func (h *AuthHandler) Handle(request *Request) error {
    token := request.Headers["Authorization"]
    if token == "" {
        return errors.New("missing auth token")
    }

    if !h.validateToken(token) {
        return errors.New("invalid auth token")
    }

    log.Printf("Auth: User %s authenticated", request.UserID)
    return h.HandleNext(request)
}

func (h *AuthHandler) validateToken(token string) bool {
    // Token validation logic
    return len(token) > 10
}

// Concrete handler: rate limiting
type RateLimitHandler struct {
    BaseHandler
    limiter *RateLimiter
}

func (h *RateLimitHandler) Handle(request *Request) error {
    if !h.limiter.Allow(request.UserID) {
        return errors.New("rate limit exceeded")
    }

    log.Printf("RateLimit: User %s within limits", request.UserID)
    return h.HandleNext(request)
}

// Concrete handler: validation
type ValidationHandler struct {
    BaseHandler
}

func (h *ValidationHandler) Handle(request *Request) error {
    if request.Method == "" {
        return errors.New("method is required")
    }

    if request.Path == "" {
        return errors.New("path is required")
    }

    log.Printf("Validation: Request valid")
    return h.HandleNext(request)
}

// Concrete handler: business logic
type BusinessLogicHandler struct {
    BaseHandler
}

func (h *BusinessLogicHandler) Handle(request *Request) error {
    log.Printf("BusinessLogic: Processing request %s %s", request.Method, request.Path)
    // Process request
    request.Response = &Response{StatusCode: 200, Body: "Success"}
    return h.HandleNext(request)
}

// Usage: build handler chain
auth := &AuthHandler{}
rateLimit := &RateLimitHandler{limiter: NewRateLimiter(100, time.Minute)}
validation := &ValidationHandler{}
business := &BusinessLogicHandler{}

// Chain handlers
auth.SetNext(rateLimit)
rateLimit.SetNext(validation)
validation.SetNext(business)

// Process request through chain
request := &Request{
    Method:  "GET",
    Path:    "/api/users",
    Headers: map[string]string{"Authorization": "Bearer token123"},
    UserID:  "user-123",
}

if err := auth.Handle(request); err != nil {
    log.Printf("Request failed: %v", err)
} else {
    log.Printf("Request succeeded: %+v", request.Response)
}
```

#### Related Patterns

- **Decorator:** Adds behavior to object (chain passes request to next handler)
- **Composite:** Tree structure (chain is linear structure)
- **Command:** Encapsulates request (chain processes request)

## Testing Patterns

### Test Doubles

#### Intent

Replace production dependencies with controlled implementations during testing to isolate unit under test, verify interactions, and simulate edge cases.

#### Types of Test Doubles

**Mock:** Verifies interactions (method calls, arguments)
**Stub:** Provides canned responses to method calls
**Fake:** Simplified working implementation (in-memory database)
**Spy:** Records interactions while delegating to real implementation

#### When to Use

- **Unit testing** where external dependencies slow tests (database, network, filesystem)
- **Integration testing** where you need to verify interactions between components
- **Edge case testing** where real dependencies can't simulate failures easily (network timeout, database deadlock)
- **Deterministic testing** where real dependencies are non-deterministic (time, random, external APIs)

#### When to Avoid

- **Integration tests** that verify real component interactions (test doubles mask integration bugs)
- **Simple functions** with no dependencies (no need for doubles)
- **Contract testing** where you're verifying against real API contracts (stubs can drift from reality)

#### Implementation Examples

**Go (Interface-Based Mocking):**
```go
// Production interface
type UserRepository interface {
    Find(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error)
    Save(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
}

// Production implementation
type PostgresUserRepository struct {
    db *sql.DB
}

func (r *PostgresUserRepository) Find(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error) {
    // Real database query
}

func (r *PostgresUserRepository) Save(ctx context.Context, user *User) error {
    // Real database insert
}

// Mock for testing
type MockUserRepository struct {
    FindFunc func(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error)
    SaveFunc func(ctx context.Context, user *User) error

    // Spy: track calls
    FindCalls []string
    SaveCalls []*User
}

func (m *MockUserRepository) Find(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error) {
    m.FindCalls = append(m.FindCalls, id)
    if m.FindFunc != nil {
        return m.FindFunc(ctx, id)
    }
    return nil, errors.New("not implemented")
}

func (m *MockUserRepository) Save(ctx context.Context, user *User) error {
    m.SaveCalls = append(m.SaveCalls, user)
    if m.SaveFunc != nil {
        return m.SaveFunc(ctx, user)
    }
    return nil
}

// Fake: in-memory implementation
type InMemoryUserRepository struct {
    users map[string]*User
    mu    sync.RWMutex
}

func NewInMemoryUserRepository() *InMemoryUserRepository {
    return &InMemoryUserRepository{users: make(map[string]*User)}
}

func (r *InMemoryUserRepository) Find(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error) {
    r.mu.RLock()
    defer r.mu.RUnlock()
    if user, ok := r.users[id]; ok {
        return user, nil
    }
    return nil, errors.New("user not found")
}

func (r *InMemoryUserRepository) Save(ctx context.Context, user *User) error {
    r.mu.Lock()
    defer r.mu.Unlock()
    r.users[user.ID] = user
    return nil
}

// Usage in tests
func TestUserService_GetUser(t *testing.T) {
    // Arrange: mock with stub behavior
    mockRepo := &MockUserRepository{
        FindFunc: func(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error) {
            return &User{ID: id, Name: "Alice"}, nil
        },
    }

    service := NewUserService(mockRepo)

    // Act
    user, err := service.GetUser(context.Background(), "user-123")

    // Assert
    require.NoError(t, err)
    assert.Equal(t, "Alice", user.Name)

    // Verify interaction
    assert.Equal(t, []string{"user-123"}, mockRepo.FindCalls)
}

func TestUserService_CreateUser_Integration(t *testing.T) {
    // Use fake for integration test
    fakeRepo := NewInMemoryUserRepository()
    service := NewUserService(fakeRepo)

    // Create user
    user := &User{ID: "user-456", Name: "Bob"}
    err := service.CreateUser(context.Background(), user)
    require.NoError(t, err)

    // Verify user was saved
    retrieved, err := service.GetUser(context.Background(), "user-456")

- **Adapter:** Test doubles often act as adapters for test scenarios
- **Strategy:** Test doubles swap strategies for testing

### Fixtures

#### Intent

Set up known test state before running tests and clean up afterward, ensuring tests are repeatable, isolated, and deterministic.

#### When to Use

- **Database tests** where you need predictable data state (seed test database before each test)
- **File system tests** where you need clean directories (create temp dirs, clean up after)
- **Time-dependent tests** where you need fixed time (freeze time to specific moment)
- **Configuration tests** where you need specific environment (set env vars, restore after)

#### When to Avoid

- **Tests without setup** where default state is sufficient (fixtures add complexity)
- **Fixtures becoming too complex** where setup logic dominates test logic (consider factory functions)
- **Shared fixtures** that create coupling between tests (prefer isolated fixtures)

#### Implementation Examples

#### Related Patterns

- **Factory:** Fixtures often use factories to create test data
- **Builder:** Complex fixtures use builder pattern for setup
- **Template Method:** Fixtures define setup/teardown template

---

### Table-Driven Tests

#### Intent

Test multiple scenarios using data tables, reducing code duplication and improving test readability by separating test logic from test data.

#### When to Use

- **Multiple similar test cases** where only inputs/outputs differ (validation: test 20 invalid email formats)
- **Boundary testing** where you test edge cases systematically (int32: min, max, zero, overflow)
- **Regression suites** where you add new test cases as bugs are found (growing list of edge cases)
- **Combinatorial testing** where you test multiple input combinations (3 auth methods × 4 roles = 12 tests)

#### When to Avoid

- **Complex setup** per test case where shared table structure is awkward
- **Different assertions** per case where test logic varies significantly
- **Single test case** where table adds unnecessary structure

#### Implementation Examples

**Go (Subtests with Table):**
```go
func TestValidateEmail(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        email   string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {"valid email", "user@example.com", false},
        {"valid with subdomain", "user@mail.example.com", false},
        {"valid with plus", "user+tag@example.com", false},
        {"missing @", "userexample.com", true},
        {"missing domain", "user@", true},
        {"missing local", "@example.com", true},
        {"empty string", "", true},
        {"whitespace", "  ", true},
        {"multiple @", "user@@example.com", true},
    }

- **Data-Driven Testing:** External data sources (CSV, JSON) drive test cases
- **Combinatorial Testing:** Test all combinations of inputs systematically

### Property-Based Testing

#### Intent

Test properties that should hold for all inputs rather than specific examples, using generated random inputs to discover edge cases automatically.

#### When to Use

- **Pure functions** with mathematical properties (commutative, associative, idempotent)
- **Encoding/decoding** where round-trip property holds (encode → decode = identity)
- **Serialization** where serialize → deserialize should preserve data
- **Invariants** that must hold regardless of input (list length after append = original + 1)

#### When to Avoid

- **Non-deterministic code** that depends on time, random, or external state
- **Complex properties** that are as hard to specify as implementation
- **Integration tests** where external dependencies make properties hard to define

#### Implementation Examples

## Error Handling Patterns

### Go Error Handling

#### Idioms

**Explicit Error Returns:**
- Functions return `(result, error)` tuple
- Callers must check `err != nil` after every call
- No exceptions; errors are values

**Error Wrapping:**
- Use `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` to wrap errors with context
- Preserves error chain for inspection with `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()`

**Sentinel Errors:**
- Package-level error variables for expected errors (e.g., `io.EOF`, `sql.ErrNoRows`)
- Enables error comparison with `errors.Is(err, io.EOF)`

**Custom Error Types:**
- Implement `error` interface for rich error information
- Use type assertions to access additional fields

#### Implementation Examples

```go
// Explicit error returns
func ReadConfig(path string) (*Config, error) {
    data, err := os.ReadFile(path)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to read config: %w", err)
    }

    var config Config
    if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &config); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse config: %w", err)
    }

    return &config, nil
}

// Error wrapping with context
func ProcessUser(id string) error {
    user, err := fetchUser(id)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("process user %s: %w", id, err)
    }

    if err := validateUser(user); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("process user %s: validation failed: %w", id, err)
    }

    return nil
}

// Sentinel errors
var (
    ErrUserNotFound    = errors.New("user not found")
    ErrInvalidEmail    = errors.New("invalid email")
    ErrDuplicateEmail  = errors.New("email already exists")
)

func FindUser(email string) (*User, error) {
    user, err := db.Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?", email)
    if err == sql.ErrNoRows {
        return nil, ErrUserNotFound
    }
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("find user: %w", err)
    }

    return user, nil
}

// Check sentinel errors
user, err := FindUser("user@example.com")
if errors.Is(err, ErrUserNotFound) {
    // Handle not found
} else if err != nil {
    // Handle other errors
}

// Custom error types
type ValidationError struct {
    Field   string
    Message string
}

func (e *ValidationError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("validation error on field %s: %s", e.Field, e.Message)
}

func ValidateUser(user *User) error {
    if !strings.Contains(user.Email, "@") {
        return &ValidationError{
            Field:   "email",
            Message: "must contain @",
        }

### TypeScript Error Handling

#### Idioms

**Try-Catch Blocks:**
- Standard exception handling with `try-catch-finally`
- Catch can be typed with `unknown` (strict mode) or `any`

**Result Types:**
- Functional error handling with `Result<T, E>` type
- Explicit success/failure variants
- No exceptions thrown

**Error Boundaries (React):**
- Component-level error handling
- Prevents entire app crash from component errors

**Promise Rejection:**
- Async errors via `.catch()` or `try-await-catch`
- Unhandled rejections should be logged

#### Implementation Examples

```typescript
// Try-catch with typed errors
class NetworkError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public statusCode: number,
    public url: string
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'NetworkError';
  }
}

async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new NetworkError(
        `Failed to fetch user ${id}`,
        response.status,
        response.url
      );
    }

    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
      console.error(`Network error ${error.statusCode}: ${error.message}`);
      throw error;
    }

    // Unknown error type
    console.error('Unexpected error:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch user');
  }
}

// Result type pattern (functional error handling)
type Result<T, E = Error> =
  | { ok: true; value: T }
  | { ok: false; error: E };

function divide(a: number, b: number): Result<number, string> {
  if (b === 0) {
    return { ok: false, error: 'Division by zero' };
  }

  return { ok: true, value: a / b };
}

// Using Result type
const result = divide(10, 2);
if (result.ok) {
  console.log(`Result: ${result.value}`);
} else {
  console.error(`Error: ${result.error}`);
}

// Result type with async operations
async function fetchUserSafe(id: string): Promise<Result<User, NetworkError>> {
  try {
    const user = await fetchUser(id);
    return { ok: true, value: user };
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
      return { ok: false, error };
    }

    return {
      ok: false,
      error: new NetworkError('Unknown error', 500, '')
    };
  }
}

// Custom error classes
class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public fields: Record<string, string>
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'ValidationError';
  }
}

class DatabaseError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public query: string,
    public cause?: Error
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'DatabaseError';
  }
}

// Error handling middleware (Express)
const errorHandler: ErrorRequestHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);

  if (err instanceof ValidationError) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      error: 'Validation failed',
      fields: err.fields
    });
  }

  if (err instanceof NetworkError) {
    return res.status(err.statusCode).json({
      error: err.message
    });
  }

  // Unknown error
  return res.status(500).json({
    error: 'Internal server error'
  });
};

// Error boundary (React)
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component<
  { children: React.ReactNode },
  { hasError: boolean; error?: Error }
> {
  constructor(props: any) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error) {
    return { hasError: true, error };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: React.ErrorInfo) {
    console.error('Error caught by boundary:', error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <ErrorFallback error={this.state.error} />;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

// Promise error handling
async function processData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    const validated = await validateData(data);
    const processed = await processValidData(validated);
    return processed;
  } catch (error) {
    // All async errors caught here
    console.error('Processing failed:', error);
    throw error;
  } finally {
    // Cleanup always runs
    cleanup();
  }
}

// Multiple promises with error handling
const results = await Promise.allSettled([
  fetchUser('1'),
  fetchUser('2'),
  fetchUser('3')
]);

for (const result of results) {
  if (result.status === 'fulfilled') {
    console.log('User:', result.value);
  } else {
    console.error('Failed:', result.reason);
  }
}
```

### Rust Error Handling

#### Idioms

**Result<T, E>:**
- Functions return `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations
- `Ok(value)` for success, `Err(error)` for failure
- Use `?` operator to propagate errors up call stack

**Option<T>:**
- Represents nullable values without null pointers
- `Some(value)` or `None`
- Use `?` operator with functions returning `Option`

**Error Trait:**
- Custom errors implement `std::error::Error` trait
- Use `thiserror` crate for deriving error implementations
- Use `anyhow` crate for application-level error handling

**Panic:**
- Unrecoverable errors (programmer bugs, invariant violations)
- `panic!()` unwinds stack by default
- Use `Result` for expected errors, `panic` for bugs

#### Implementation Examples

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

// Result type with ? operator
fn read_file(path: &str) -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut file = File::open(path)?; // ? propagates error
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    Ok(contents)
}

// Custom error types with thiserror
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
enum ConfigError {
    #[error("Failed to read config file: {0}")]
    Io(#[from] io::Error),

    #[error("Failed to parse config: {0}")]
    Parse(#[from] serde_json::Error),

    #[error("Invalid config: {0}")]
    Invalid(String),
}

fn load_config(path: &str) -> Result<Config, ConfigError> {
    let contents = std::fs::read_to_string(path)?; // io::Error auto-converted

    let config: Config = serde_json::from_str(&contents)?; // serde error auto-converted

    if config.port == 0 {
        return Err(ConfigError::Invalid("Port cannot be 0".to_string()));
    }

    Ok(config)
}

// Application errors with anyhow
use anyhow::{Context, Result};

fn process_user(id: &str) -> Result<()> {
    let user = fetch_user(id)
        .context(format!("Failed to fetch user {}", id))?;

    validate_user(&user)
        .context("User validation failed")?;

    save_user(&user)
        .context("Failed to save user")?;

    Ok(())
}

// Option<T> for nullable values
fn find_user_by_email(email: &str) -> Option<User> {
    DATABASE.get(email).cloned()
}

// Using Option with ? operator
fn get_user_name(email: &str) -> Option<String> {
    let user = find_user_by_email(email)?; // Returns None if not found
    Some(user.name)
}

// Converting Option to Result
fn require_user(email: &str) -> Result<User, String> {
    find_user_by_email(email)
        .ok_or_else(|| format!("User not found: {}", email))
}

// Match for explicit error handling
match read_file("config.json") {
    Ok(contents) => println!("Config: {}", contents),
    Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to read config: {}", e),
}

// Unwrap alternatives
let config = read_file("config.json")
    .expect("Config file must exist"); // Panic with custom message

let config = read_file("config.json")
    .unwrap_or_default(); // Use default on error

let config = read_file("config.json")
    .unwrap_or_else(|e| {
        eprintln!("Warning: Failed to load config: {}", e);
        Config::default()
    });

// Error propagation in async functions
async fn fetch_and_process(id: &str) -> Result<ProcessedData> {
    let data = fetch_data(id).await
        .context("Failed to fetch data")?;

    let validated = validate(data)
        .context("Validation failed")?;

    let processed = process(validated).await
        .context("Processing failed")?;

    Ok(processed)
}

// Collecting Results
let results: Result<Vec<User>, Error> = ids
    .iter()
    .map(|id| fetch_user(id))
    .collect(); // Stops at first error

// Partition successes and failures
let (users, errors): (Vec<_>, Vec<_>) = ids
    .iter()
    .map(|id| fetch_user(id))
    .partition(Result::is_ok);

// Panic for programmer errors
fn get_element(vec: &Vec<i32>, index: usize) -> i32 {
    assert!(index < vec.len(), "Index out of bounds");
    vec[index]
}

// Custom panic hook
std::panic::set_hook(Box::new(|panic_info| {
    eprintln!("Panic occurred: {:?}", panic_info);
    // Send to error reporting service
}));
```

### Python Error Handling

#### Idioms

**Try-Except-Finally:**
- Standard exception handling
- Multiple except blocks for different exception types
- Finally block for cleanup

**Context Managers:**
- `with` statement ensures cleanup (files, locks, transactions)
- Implements `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods

**Custom Exceptions:**
- Inherit from `Exception` or specific exception types
- Add custom attributes for error details

**EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission):**
- Try operation and catch exception (Pythonic)
- Opposite of LBYL (Look Before You Leap)

#### Implementation Examples
