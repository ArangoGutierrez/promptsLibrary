# mutation-gate.sh - Incremental mutation testing on changed files
# Usage: mutation-gate.sh [--threshold N]
#
# Runs mutation testing ONLY on packages/modules with changes.
# If surviving mutant rate exceeds threshold, exits non-zero.
#
# Designed to be called:
#   - Manually between Green and Refactor phases
#   - By QA validator in team workflows
#   - By tdd-protocol skill as a quality gate
#
# Exit 0 = mutation score acceptable
# Exit 1 = mutation score too low (theater tests detected)
# Exit 2 = mutation tool not available (skip gracefully)
