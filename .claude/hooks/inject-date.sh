TODAY: $DATE
CURRENT YEAR: $YEAR
RULE: When writing dates or years in ANY context (copyright headers, license files, documentation, commit messages, changelogs, comments, code), always use $YEAR as the current year. Never use years from training data or copy years from existing files in the project. New files get $YEAR. Year ranges in existing files being updated should end with $YEAR.
