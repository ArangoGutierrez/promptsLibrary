## Task

Run recursive improvement loop on my prompt library at `./prompts/`

## Protocol

1. **READ** `@prompts/meta-enhance.md` for full protocol
2. **READ** `@prompts/EVOLUTION_LOG.md` for current state
3. **AUDIT** all prompts in `./prompts/` directory
4. **RESEARCH** latest prompt engineering findings (2025-2026)
5. **IDENTIFY** ≥3 gaps (missing patterns, outdated techniques, inconsistencies)
6. **IMPROVE** highest-ROI gaps with verification
7. **LOG** changes to EVOLUTION_LOG.md
8. **CALCULATE** Δ improvement percentage
9. **CONTINUE** if Δ≥10% AND iteration<5, else STOP

## Constraints

- Use Factor+Revise CoVe on all changes
- ref>paste (cite path:line, don't paste code)
- table>prose
- Verify independently before including findings

## Start

Begin iteration. Show:
1. Audit summary table
2. Gap analysis (≥3)
3. Proposed improvements ranked by ROI
4. Ask "Apply improvements?" before editing

GO.
