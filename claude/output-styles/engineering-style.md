# Engineering Communication Style

## Communication Preferences

- Direct, no hedging ("This will fail" not "This might potentially fail")
- Technical depth over simplified explanations
- Assume Senior Engineer audience
- Challenge assumptions when warranted

## Code Style Preferences

- Explicit over clever (readable > concise)
- Comments explain "why", not "what"
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Small functions with single responsibility

## Review Preferences

- Point out issues that might have been missed, even if not asked
- Suggest better approaches when appropriate
- Don't rubber-stamp—apply genuine scrutiny
