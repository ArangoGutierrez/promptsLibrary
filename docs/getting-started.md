# Getting Started

Welcome to the AI Engineering Dotfiles repo. This guide walks you through installing the configuration, verifying it works, and running your first workflow. If you are new to Claude Code or Cursor, that is fine — this guide explains what everything does as you go.

For a deeper look at why things are structured this way, see [Architecture](architecture.md).

---

## Prerequisites

You need the following tools installed before deploying these dotfiles.

### macOS or Linux

Windows and WSL have not been tested. macOS (12 Monterey or later) and common Linux distributions (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 38+) are known to work.

### Git 2.20+

Required for `git worktree` support, which is central to this workflow.

```bash
# macOS
brew install git

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git

# Verify
git --version
```

### jq

Used by hooks that parse JSON configuration and output.

```bash
# macOS
brew install jq

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install jq

# Verify
jq --version
```

### GPG with a signing key

Commits made during Claude Code sessions are enforced to be signed. You need GPG installed and a signing key configured.

```bash
# macOS
brew install gnupg

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install gnupg

# Generate a key if you do not have one
gpg --gen-key

# List your keys to confirm
gpg --list-keys

# Configure Git to use your key (replace KEY_ID with the fingerprint shown above)
git config --global user.signingkey <KEY_ID>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

### rsync

Used by `deploy.sh` and `capture.sh` to sync files between the repo and your home directory.

```bash
# macOS (the system rsync is usually sufficient, but brew provides a newer version)
brew install rsync

# Linux — rsync is typically pre-installed. If not:
sudo apt install rsync   # Ubuntu / Debian
sudo dnf install rsync   # Fedora
```

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArangoGutierrez/promptsLibrary.git
cd promptsLibrary
```

### 2. Preview what will be deployed

Run a dry-run first so you can see exactly which files will be installed and what will be backed up:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --dry-run
```

This shows the rsync output without writing anything to disk.

### 3. Deploy

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

What this does:

- Rsyncs `.claude/` from the repo into `~/.claude/`
- Rsyncs `.cursor/` from the repo into `~/.cursor/`
- Creates a timestamped backup of any existing files at `~/.config/dotfiles-backup/` before overwriting them (for example: `~/.config/dotfiles-backup/claude-2026-02-20T14-30-00.tar.gz`)

The script is safe to re-run. Each run creates a fresh backup before making changes, so you can always roll back.

For a full explanation of `deploy.sh`, `capture.sh`, and `diff.sh`, see [Deployment Scripts](deployment.md).

---

## Verify Installation

After deploying, run the following checks to confirm everything is in place.

### Hooks are executable

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/hooks/
```

You should see six scripts, all with executable permissions (`-rwxr-xr-x`):

- `enforce-worktree.sh` — blocks implementation in the main branch
- `inject-date.sh` — injects the current date into Claude Code context
- `prevent-push-workbench.sh` — prevents pushing the `agents-workbench` branch
- `sign-commits.sh` — enforces signed commits (`-s -S` flags)
- `tdd-guard.sh` — blocks writing implementation files when no test file exists
- `validate-year.sh` — validates that year references in generated content are current

If any file is missing the executable bit:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/*.sh
```

### Signed commit enforcement

Open a Claude Code session inside any Git repository and ask it to commit something without the `-s -S` flags. The `sign-commits.sh` hook should block the commit and ask you to use `git commit -s -S -m "..."` instead.

### TDD guard

In a Claude Code session, ask it to write an implementation file (for example, a new `.go` or `.py` file) without first creating a corresponding test file. The `tdd-guard.sh` hook should block the write and prompt you to write the test first.

To bypass for a one-off case (for example, when adding a config file that genuinely has no test):

```bash
SKIP_TDD_GUARD=1 git commit ...
```

### Claude Code plugins loaded

Check that the expected plugins are registered:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/hooks/../plugins/installed_plugins.json
```

You should see entries for at minimum:

- `superpowers` — brainstorming, CoVe verification, and planning commands
- `code-review` — structured code review slash command
- `code-simplifier` — complexity reduction slash command
- `gopls-lsp` — Go language server integration

---

## Your First Workflow

This repo enforces a worktree-based development model. You never commit implementation work directly to `main` or `master`. Instead:

1. A local `agents-workbench` branch serves as your coordination hub (never pushed to remote).
2. All feature work happens in `.worktrees/<name>/`, each on its own branch.

Here is a minimal walkthrough.

### Step 1: Set up the agents-workbench branch

```bash
git checkout -b agents-workbench
```

This branch is where you plan work, write `AGENTS.md`, and keep `.agents/plans/` documents. It is never pushed.

### Step 2: Create a worktree for your feature

Always branch from the remote ref (not local `main`) to avoid working from a stale base:

```bash
git fetch origin
BASE="origin/$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')"
git worktree add .worktrees/my-feature -b feat/my-feature "$BASE"
cd .worktrees/my-feature
```

### Step 3: Write a failing test first

The TDD guard requires a test file to exist before you can write implementation. Create your test:

```bash
# Example for a Go project
touch pkg/myfeature/myfeature_test.go
# Write your failing test, then run it to confirm it fails
go test ./pkg/myfeature/...
```

### Step 4: Write the implementation

Now that a test file exists, the TDD guard will allow implementation files. Write the minimum code to make the test pass.

### Step 5: Commit with signing flags

The `sign-commits.sh` hook enforces both a DCO sign-off (`-s`) and a GPG signature (`-S`):

```bash
git add .
git commit -s -S -m "feat: add myfeature"
```

### Step 6: Push and open a PR

```bash
git push -u origin feat/my-feature
gh pr create --title "feat: add myfeature" --body "..."
```

### Step 7: Clean up after merge

Once the PR is merged, remove the worktree:

```bash
git worktree remove .worktrees/my-feature
```

For the full architectural rationale behind this workflow, see [Architecture](architecture.md).

## Customization

### Disable a hook

Hooks are registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `hooks` array. To disable one, remove its entry from that array. You can also edit the source in `.claude/hooks/` and re-deploy.

### Change Claude Code permissions

The `allow`, `deny`, and `ask` lists in `~/.claude/settings.json` control what actions Claude Code can take without prompting. Edit these lists to match your risk tolerance. See [Claude Code Configuration](claude-code.md) for the full reference.

### Add a Cursor agent

Create a `.md` file in `.cursor/agents/` with the appropriate frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `model`). Deploy with `./scripts/deploy.sh` to sync it to `~/.cursor/agents/`. See [Cursor Configuration](cursor.md) for the frontmatter schema.

### Add a Cursor command

Create a `.md` file in `.cursor/commands/`. Commands group agents and define multi-step workflows. See [Cursor Configuration](cursor.md) for examples and the full reference.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "GPG not found" or signing fails

```bash
# Install GPG
brew install gnupg          # macOS
sudo apt install gnupg      # Ubuntu / Debian

# Generate a key if you do not have one
gpg --gen-key

# Find your key ID
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

# Configure Git (replace KEY_ID with the long key ID shown above)
git config --global user.signingkey <KEY_ID>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

If you are on macOS and Git cannot find the GPG binary:

```bash
git config --global gpg.program gpg
```

### "Permission denied" on hooks

```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/*.sh
```

### Worktree conflicts

If a worktree was deleted without being removed from Git's tracking:

```bash
# List all registered worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove stale entries
git worktree prune
```

### TDD guard blocking unexpectedly

The guard checks for the presence of a test file before allowing implementation writes. If it is blocking something that genuinely does not need a test (configuration files, generated files, documentation):

```bash
SKIP_TDD_GUARD=1 git commit -s -S -m "chore: add config file"
```

Use this sparingly. The guard exists to enforce TDD discipline.

### Deploy overwrote my local changes

Check the automatic backups created before each deploy:

```bash
ls ~/.config/dotfiles-backup/
```

Each entry is a timestamped `.tar.gz` archive. Extract the one you need:

```bash
tar -xzf ~/.config/dotfiles-backup/claude-<timestamp>.tar.gz -C /tmp/restore/
```

Then copy the files you need back into place.
