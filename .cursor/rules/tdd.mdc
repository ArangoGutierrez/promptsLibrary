# TDD Protocol

## Phase Signals (prefix every implementation response)
- `[PLAN]` — designing/specifying before code
- `[RED]` — writing or presenting a failing test
- `[GREEN]` — writing minimum code to pass the test
- `[REFACTOR]` — cleaning up after green, no behavior change
- `[CHECKPOINT]` — requesting human commit before large refactor

## Hard Rules
- RED before GREEN: never write implementation without a failing test first
- One phase per turn: never mix test changes and implementation in the same edit
- Fitness function: tests are contracts — never modify tests to make implementation pass
- Batch size: each PR ≤ 1 concern; break down first if > 1

## Checkpoint Protocol
Before any REFACTOR touching > 3 files or > 50 LOC:
1. Signal `[CHECKPOINT]` and summarize current GREEN state
2. Ask human to review diff and commit
3. Wait for confirmation before proceeding
4. Begin REFACTOR as a new atomic change after checkpoint

## Context Verification
At implementation start, verify you have:
- API docs for external services being integrated
- Team conventions for the language/framework in use
- Existing test patterns in the repo
If any missing → ask before writing code. Never guess at APIs or conventions.

## Security Scans (verify phase)
Run language-appropriate scans before claiming implementation is complete:
- Detect project language from files present (go.mod → Go, package.json → Node, etc.)
- Use the language-specific rule (go.mdc, etc.) for exact scan commands
- Always run: `trivy fs .` for filesystem/dependency vulnerability scan
