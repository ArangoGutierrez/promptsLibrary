# Core

## Workflow
Phases: brainstorm → plan → code → verify → PR → review → address → CI → merge

## Commits
- Always sign: `git commit -s -S` (DCO + GPG) — no exceptions
- Never use `--no-verify` — hooks are safety rails
- Never force-push to main/master

## TDD Invariant
- RED before GREEN — never write implementation without a failing test
- One phase per turn — never mix test and implementation edits
- Tests are contracts — never weaken tests to pass implementation

## Verification
- Evidence before claim — run tests/lints/scans before asserting success
- File:line references must exist — verify before citing

## Dates & Years
- Source of truth: "Today's date" from system context — never training data
- New files: always current year (2026) — never copy from existing files
- Year ranges: first-year–current (e.g. 2024–2026) only when history applies
- Applies to: copyright headers, changelogs, commits, docs, test fixtures

## Context Economy
- Reference over paste — use file paths not inline code
- Tables over prose — structured data is cheaper
- Delta-only — show only what changed

## Agent Dispatch
- Inherit model from parent unless task requires different capability
- Ask before dispatching to a different model
